# Water Data Boot Camp: Unit 2
```
Instructors: John Fay and Lauren Patterson
Feb 16, 2018 -- EH 1104
```

### Overview:

Here, we introduce the **Python** and **R** scripting environments in the context of analyzing the same water flow data we did in the [Unit 1](https://datadevils.github.io/DataBootCamp/Streamflow_Intro.html). In doing so, we touch on the following concepts:

* Basics of coding (variables, syntax, data types, packages, etc.)

* Basics of data in a coding environment (import/export, data types, & data structures)

* Data operations: subset, field calculations, summarizing, transforming, statistical analysis, and plotting.
